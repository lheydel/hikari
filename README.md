# MCP Powerup

A JetBrains IDE plugin that adds tools to the IDE's built-in MCP server. It exposes IntelliJ's
**local changelists**, so an MCP client (e.g. Claude Code) can read changelist state, draft commit
messages from a changelist's diff, and organize modified files into changelists for you to review
and commit.

> **Read and organize only.** This plugin never mutates file contents or VCS state — it never commits,
> pushes, stashes, reverts, shelves, or edits a file. It reads state and rearranges which changelist a
> change belongs to. Scheduling *new* files for addition (add-to-VCS) into a changelist — the git
> equivalent of marking a new file to be tracked — is the single exception, and you still review and
> commit manually. That boundary is absolute, and it does not widen with the tool surface.

## Why

A common flow is: the agent implements → you review the diffs in IntelliJ (per changelist, with
granular per-line selection) → you commit in IntelliJ → you push. Gaps make that awkward:

- `git diff` / `git diff --cached` doesn't reflect IntelliJ's changelist grouping (IntelliJ does partial
  commits without staging via the index), so the agent can't see "the files I'm about to commit as one unit."
- You don't want to hand-sort implementation changes into changelists, and you don't want to copy/paste
  commit messages out of a chat.

This plugin closes these gaps while keeping commit & push firmly in your hands.

## Requirements

- **IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1 or newer** (build `261+`). The MCP server is bundled in the IDE since 2025.2, and
  this plugin uses the 2026.1 MCP API (`McpToolset` + the `McpCallInfoKt` project accessor). It will not
  load on older builds — `sinceBuild` is `261`.
- Works on both IDEA Community and Ultimate (since 2025.3 they're a single distribution).

## Tools

| Tool | Arguments | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list_changelists` | — | Read every local changelist with its files (project-relative paths; `changeType` ∈ MODIFIED/ADDED/DELETED/MOVED), plus `isDefault`/`isReadOnly`, and the project's `unversionedFiles` (new, not-yet-tracked files). Comments come back as `commentFirstLine` (subject line, capped at 120 chars) and `commentLength` — read one in full with `get_changelist_comment`. |
| `refresh_changelists` | — | Re-scan the working tree and recompute changelist state. **Call this after editing files outside the IDE** (e.g. via Claude's own tools), before `list_changelists` — IntelliJ doesn't see external edits until it refreshes. |
| `get_changelist_diff` | `name` | Unified diff for one changelist (capped at 200 KB), for drafting a commit message. |
| `create_changelist` | `name`, `comment?`, `files?`, `setActive?`, `from?` | Create a changelist and put files into it: modified files are moved **whole**; **unversioned (new) files are scheduled for addition** and reported in `addedFiles`. `movedCount` says how many landed. Non-matching / missing files go to `skippedFiles`; the call still succeeds. |
| `move_to_changelist` | `name`, `files`, `from?` | Put files into an **existing** changelist (modified → moved whole, new → scheduled for addition / `addedFiles`). `from` scopes the move to one changelist's changes — see [Parallel sessions](#parallel-sessions). `movedCount` says how many landed — which ones is the request minus `skippedFiles`; everything else comes back in `skippedFiles` with a reason (`split_across_changelists`, `not_in_source`, `move_incomplete`, …) and `remainingIn`. Fails if the changelist is missing (never auto-creates) or read-only. |
| `move_lines_to_changelist` | `name`, `file`, `lineRanges` | Move only specific **hunks** of one file into an existing changelist, leaving its other changes in place. See [Parallel sessions](#parallel-sessions). |
| `get_changelist_comment` | `name` | Read one changelist's full comment. `list_changelists` only broadcasts each comment's first line, so fetch the whole text here when extending an existing message. |
| `set_changelist_comment` | `name`, `comment` | Set a changelist's comment, which IntelliJ uses as the **default commit message** — so the commit dialog is pre-filled. **Use a *named* changelist:** the default `Changes` ignores its comment (the dialog shows the last commit message instead). |
| `delete_changelist` | `name`, `moveContentsTo?` | Delete a changelist, relocating its files first (default target `"Default"`). Refuses to delete `Default`. |

They register through a `McpToolset`; they appear alongside the IDE's built-in MCP tools.

## Intended workflow

1. The agent finishes implementing.
2. It calls `refresh_changelists` (its edits were written to disk outside the IDE), then `list_changelists`,
   and **leaves user-curated buckets alone** (anything read-only, or named like "do not commit", "local",
   "wip-keep").
3. It groups the new changes into logical **named** changelists with `create_changelist` /
   `move_to_changelist` — one per intended commit. (Not the default `Changes`: the commit dialog ignores
   the default changelist's description, so a comment set there won't pre-fill — see below.)
4. It drafts a message from `get_changelist_diff` and writes it with `set_changelist_comment`, so your
   commit dialog opens pre-filled — no copy/paste.
5. **You** review in IntelliJ, reshuffle freely, and commit per group. **You** push. The plugin never does.

### Parallel sessions

When several agent sessions share one working tree, a single file can hold changes from more than one
session, and its hunks end up spread over several changelists. Moving such a file whole would drag another
session's work along, so the whole-file tools refuse it: it comes back in `skippedFiles` as
`split_across_changelists`, with `remainingIn` naming every changelist holding a piece. Ways forward:

- **`from`** — `move_to_changelist(name, files, from = "Changes")` takes only the changes that changelist
  holds. The hunks sitting in other changelists stay exactly where they are. Use this when your work is
  cleanly separated by changelist and you just want to relabel your bucket. `from` filters the whole call
  uniformly: anything it does not hold is skipped as `not_in_source` — a file that lives entirely in
  another changelist, and a new/unversioned file, which no changelist holds (so a scoped call never
  schedules one for addition; do that in a separate unscoped call).
- **`move_lines_to_changelist`** — hunk-level precision when it is not. Read `get_changelist_diff` to find
  the line numbers of *your* hunks (the `+` side of each `@@` header) and pass those 1-based ranges. Only
  the hunks overlapping your ranges move; the rest stay put.

Each rides on IntelliJ's partial-changelist (per-hunk) tracking. `move_lines_to_changelist` is best-effort:
tracker initialization is asynchronous and hunk boundaries come from a slightly different diff engine than
the unified diff, so rare edge cases may move a neighbouring hunk. Its result reports exactly which hunks
moved and which requested ranges matched nothing.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

Produces the installable archive at `build/distributions/intellij-mcp-powerup-<version>.zip`.

Other useful tasks:

```bash
./gradlew verifyPlugin   # plugin-structure + binary-compatibility check against the target IDE
./gradlew runIde         # launch a sandbox IDE with the plugin loaded (isolated from your real IDE)
```

## Install

If the older **Changelist MCP** plugin (id `dev.kosmio.changelist-mcp`) is still installed, uninstall it
first and restart: it has a different id, so the IDE treats it as a separate plugin, and with both
installed, both register `list_changelists` and the MCP server sees a name collision at runtime.

Then, in your IDE: **Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…**, pick the built `.zip`, and restart.

## Connect an MCP client

The plugin's tools are served by the IDE's built-in MCP server, so connecting is the same as for any
JetBrains MCP tool:

1. **Settings → Tools → MCP Server** → enable the server.
2. **Auto-configure Claude Code** from that page (the IDE detects the client and writes the correct SSE
   entry itself), or add it manually with the URL shown there:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport sse intellij http://localhost:<port>/sse
   ```
3. Verify with `claude mcp list`, then `/mcp` in a session to see the changelist tools alongside the built-ins.

> When several projects/instances are open, MCP calls resolve the target by **project path** — pass the
> working directory as `projectPath` (the framework injects this argument into every tool).

## Limitations

- **Single VCS root.** Path resolution uses `project.basePath`; multi-root projects are out of scope.
- **No streaming.** Large diffs are truncated at 200 KB with a marker.
- **Partial moves are best-effort** — see [Parallel sessions](#parallel-sessions).

## Development notes

The build targets a specific toolchain (each pinned for a concrete reason):

- IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin **2.16.0** → requires **Gradle 9+** (wrapper is 9.4.1).
- **Kotlin 2.3.21** — the 2026.1 platform ships kotlin-stdlib metadata 2.3.0; an older compiler can't read it.
- **JVM 21**.
- Platform dependency is `intellijIdea("2026.1.3")` (the `IC`/`IU` artifacts merged since 2025.3).
- Depends on the bundled `com.intellij.mcpServer` plugin and the bundled modules
  `intellij.platform.vcs.impl` (for `ChangeListManagerEx`, the patch builder, the line-status tracker) and
  `intellij.platform.vcs.impl.shared` (for `LocalRange`).
- `kotlinx-serialization-json` is `compileOnly` — the platform ships its own copy; bundling ours would clash.
